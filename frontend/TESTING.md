To-Do List: AI Medical Diet Coach Implementation
1. Audit Current Implementation
 Cursor Check: Review existing codebase for:

Meal logging (already implemented—verify completeness and data structure).

Goals tracking (already implemented—verify persistence and retrieval).

Symptom logging (check if present; if yes, assess structure & quality).

Timestamp handling for logs.

 Identify any duplication or overlapping logic before adding new features.

2. Symptom Tracking Enhancements
 Add comprehensive symptom logging:

Standardized symptom descriptors (dropdowns, tags).

Free-text notes for additional context.

Symptom severity scale (e.g., 1–10).

 Ensure symptoms can be linked contextually to:

Meals.

Lifestyle habits (e.g., sleep, exercise, stress).

 Add validation rules to prevent inconsistent entries (e.g., severity without a symptom type).

3. Meal Data Expansion
 Support nutritional breakdown for each meal:

Macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats).

Micronutrients (vitamins, minerals).

 Allow customization for dietary restrictions:

Vegan, halal, low-FODMAP, gluten-free, etc.

 Ensure accurate timestamping for all entries.

4. Temporal Data Correlation
 Implement logic to correlate:

Food intake → symptom onset time.

Habit adherence → symptom improvement/worsening.

 Create backend queries or AI-ready data structures to support pattern detection.

5. User Feedback Loop
 Prompt users at set intervals for subjective feedback on:

Diet effectiveness.

Symptom improvement.

Ease of following the plan.

 Store feedback for AI retraining or prompt updates.

6. AI Prompt Engineering
 Design context-aware AI prompts that:

Include recent meal logs, symptom severity, and goals.

Account for dietary restrictions and medical conditions.

 Implement prompt modularity:

Separate prompt templates for different symptom domains (skin, digestion, fatigue).

 Add explainability:

Show which foods or habits the AI believes are contributing to symptoms.

 Support incremental learning:

Adjust AI responses based on logged feedback without overfitting.

7. Data Validation & Quality Assurance
 Add sanity checks for:

Missing timestamps.

Unusually high/low nutrient values.

Contradictory symptom logs.

 Implement automated tests for input validation.
